# Module_4
# Code Structure and Explanation

# 1. Data Preparation:

Imports: Necessary libraries are imported for working with zip files (zipfile), file paths (os), data manipulation (pandas), and data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn).
Unzipping: The zip file containing the dataset is extracted to a designated folder.
Loading: The CSV file within the extracted folder is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

# 2. Data Cleaning:

Missing Values: The code checks for missing values in the dataset and fills them with appropriate values.

# 3. Data Exploration:

Summary Statistics: The describe method provides a summary of the dataset, including counts, means, standard deviations, and other statistical measures.
Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix is generated to identify relationships between numerical variables.

# 4. Data Visualization:

Genre Popularity: A count plot visualizes the most watched genres.
Rating Distribution: A histogram with a KDE plot shows the distribution of ratings.
